#### Note-> python file and jupyter file are just for reference, you can use either one as per your choice, provided your system matches the requirements, for editing the code as per your needs.
#### Disclaimer->-this is not an advisory application. Please do your own due diligence before engaging in constructing a portfolio as per this code. The code works on backward looking data, which cannot be the best reliable way of predicting future returns.
#### Small advice for smoother functioning-> use jupyter file for custom-editing the code and python for executing code in excel. Also if you are editing jupyter code, please download the .py file before giving it to the python file path in xlwings add-in inside Excel.
